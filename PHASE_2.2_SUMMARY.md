# Phase 2.2 Training Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the LightGBM training pipeline for the Boursomatic trading recommendation system as specified in issue #[P0][Phase 2.2].

## Files Created

### 1. `backend/train.py` (20KB)
Main training script implementing the complete ML pipeline:
- **Data Loading**: Loads features from database with configurable lookback period
- **Label Generation**: Creates BUY/HOLD/SELL labels based on 20-day forward returns
  - BUY: Return ≥ 5%
  - SELL: Return ≤ -2%
  - HOLD: Between thresholds
- **Data Split**: Chronological train/val/test split (70/15/15)
- **Classifier Training**: LightGBM multi-class model for recommendations
- **Regressor Training**: LightGBM model for expected return prediction
- **Metrics Logging**: 
  - Precision BUY (key metric for MVP)
  - Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
  - Maximum Drawdown (worst-case loss)
  - Accuracy, RMSE, MAE, R²
- **Artifact Export**: Saves models, metrics, and feature importance
- **Database Integration**: Stores ModelVersion with full metadata

## Key Features

### Reproducibility
- Fixed random seed: `RANDOM_SEED = 42`
- Parameters hash stored in database
- Deterministic LightGBM training
- Chronological (not random) splits

### Metrics Logged
All acceptance criteria metrics are implemented:

1. **Precision BUY**: What % of BUY recommendations are profitable
   - Primary metric for MVP
   - Calculated on validation and test sets
   
2. **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
   - Measures strategy performance
   - Annualized from daily returns
   
3. **Maximum Drawdown**: Worst peak-to-trough decline
   - Critical for risk management
   - Helps understand downside risk

Additional metrics:
- Classification accuracy
- Regressor RMSE, MAE, R²
- Full classification report
- Feature importance rankings

### Artifact Management
All artifacts properly exported:
- ✅ Classifier model (pickle format)
- ✅ Regressor model (pickle format)
- ✅ Metrics JSON (all logged metrics)
- ✅ Feature importance CSV (ranked by importance)
- ✅ Database ModelVersion record with metadata

### Database Integration
- Queries Feature, PriceBar, and Instrument tables
- Saves ModelVersion with:
  - Unique version timestamp
  - Parameters hash for reproducibility
  - Complete metrics JSON
  - Artifact path
  - `is_active` flag (deactivates previous models)

## Usage

### Basic
```bash
cd backend
python train.py
```

### With Options
```bash
# Train with 1500 days of data
python train.py --lookback-days 1500

# Custom artifacts directory
python train.py --artifacts-dir ./models/v1

# Full example
python train.py --lookback-days 2000 --artifacts-dir ./production_models
```

- **HOLD**: Everything in between

These can be customized by editing the `create_labels()` function.

### Performance Metrics

**Sharpe Ratio Calculation:**
- Uses actual trading strategy simulation
- BUY: Long position
- SELL: Short position  
- HOLD: No position
- Annualized from daily returns

**Maximum Drawdown:**
- Tracks cumulative returns
- Finds largest peak-to-trough decline
- Important for risk assessment

## Dependencies Met

✅ **Phase 2.1**: Relies on features computed in Phase 2.1
- Uses `get_feature_columns()` from `app.features`
- Queries `Feature` table populated by feature computation
- Integrates with existing database schema

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 2.3**: Walk-forward validation
   - Use trained models for rolling validation
   - Monitor Precision BUY over time
   
2. **Phase 2.4**: Batch inference
   - Load trained models from artifacts
   - Generate recommendations for all instruments
   - Populate `recommendations` table

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Schedule periodic retraining
   - Monitor model drift
   - Update active model in database

## Notes for Deployment

### First Run
```bash
# 1. Ensure database has features
python scripts/compute_features.py  # (if exists)

# 2. Run training
python train.py --lookback-days 2000

# 3. Check artifacts
ls -lh artifacts/

# 4. Verify database
psql -d boursomatic -c "SELECT * FROM model_versions ORDER BY trained_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

### Monitoring
The script logs clearly identify each phase, making it easy to:
- Track progress
- Identify bottlenecks
- Debug issues
- Monitor metrics

### Error Handling
- Validates database connection
- Checks for sufficient data
- Handles missing features gracefully
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Conclusion

The Phase 2.2 implementation is **complete and production-ready**:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
- ✅ Full documentation
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Ready for Phase 2.3 (walk-forward validation)

The training pipeline successfully implements LightGBM classifier and regressor with all required metrics logging and artifact export, providing a solid foundation for the Boursomatic ML system.
